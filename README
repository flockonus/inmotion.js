JavaScript InMotion
===================

-- Editor under dev

-- What is the idea ?

This will be a JS Library that will have Moving Tween functionalities like the ones seen in Flash for a while. Should be an improvement


-- Progress  

I decided that I would start by the editor leaving the animation core for when I had the data structure concise.  
The idea is that having the whole structure done I would be more excited to finish the most complex  


-- Current  

There is an GUI bone editor  
The shape suported now is: 'linear'  
Multiple Key Frames (shading the last bones from the past KF)  
Being able to move Bones  
Fully able to KFs data  


-- Todo  

Animate!  
Shortcuts  


-- Bugs

Adding a KF clones the current KF instead of the last one OR the new KF should be added imediately after the current
