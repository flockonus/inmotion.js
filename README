JavaScript InMotion
===================

-- Editor under dev

-- What is the idea ?

This will be a JS Library that will have Moving Tween functionalities like the ones seen in Flash now a days.


-- Progress  

I decided that I would start by the editor leaving the animation core for when I had the data structure concise.
The idea is that having the whole structure done I would be more excited to finish the most complex 


-- Current  

There is an GUI bone editor
The shape suported now is: 'linear'
Multiple Key Frames


--Todo  

Check Pivotal Tracker
